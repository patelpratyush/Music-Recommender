# Music-Recommender

This is project that I created during my first semster of my freshman year.

The learning objectives of this assignment were:
• Practice with imperative programming (while-and for-loops) and mutable data types (lists and dictionaries).
• Practice designing a program that combines several features and needs to be im- plemented using several functions.


I use python for this project.
